About me
======
I’m currently a PhD student at Computer Vision Group|TUM. My research is co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers and Prof. Dr. Niclas Zeller. My research interests include 3D Computer Vision and Scene Understanding, and my research is driven by a strong desire to build intelligent agents that understand, interact with, and reason about the world, thus assisting in human daily life.
I completed my Diplôme d'ingénieur (M.S.) at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in 2022,and my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2016.
